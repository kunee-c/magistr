However, the support I have received from my teacher has been non-judgemental, focused and most importantly of all not overwhelming! My teacher has provided me with excellent support thus far and I'm looking forward to continue to develop my writing ability with her! :)"

In plain speech during telephone conversations {name} told me what was wrong with my essay and told me how to fix it. {name} read each redraft and gave quality feedback and specific things to work on. Using {name} was the cleverest thing I did to solve the problem created by my uni's lack of availability."
